# Requirements Generation Methodology

## Overview

This methodology provides a systematic approach for transforming project documents into structured requirements packages that serve as the foundation for architecture design. The methodology focuses on the Engineering Manager (EM) / Requirements Engineer persona and ensures consistent quality, completeness, and traceability across all requirements components.

## Requirements Package Components

A complete requirements package includes:
- **Functional Requirements** with clear acceptance criteria
- **Non-Functional Requirements** with measurable targets
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix** linking to source documents
- **User Stories** with detailed acceptance criteria
- **Requirements organization** for architecture design

---

## Input Document Processing

### Supported Input Types
- **Statement of Work (SOW)** - Project scope, deliverables, timelines
- **Opportunity Quality Review (OQR)** - Business case, technical requirements
- **Business Requirements Documents** - Functional specifications
- **Meeting Notes** - Stakeholder discussions, decisions
- **Technical Assessments** - Current state analysis, constraints

### Document Analysis Framework
When processing input documents, extract and categorize information into:

1. **Business Context**
   - Project objectives and success criteria
   - Stakeholder requirements and constraints
   - Market context and competitive landscape
   - Budget and timeline parameters

2. **Technical Context**
   - Current system architecture and limitations
   - Technology stack preferences and constraints
   - Integration requirements and dependencies
   - Performance and scalability requirements

3. **User Context**
   - Target user segments and personas
   - User workflows and pain points
   - Accessibility and usability requirements
   - User experience expectations

## Requirements Documentation Structure

### 1. Functional Requirements (FR)
Structure each functional requirement as:

```markdown
### FR-[ID]: [Requirement Title]
- **Description**: Clear, concise description of what the system must do
- **Business Justification**: Why this requirement is necessary
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Specific, testable conditions that must be met
  - Include happy path and edge case scenarios
  - Define input/output specifications
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low based on business impact
- **Dependencies**: Other requirements this depends on
- **Assumptions**: Any assumptions made about this requirement
```

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
Structure each non-functional requirement as:

```markdown
### NFR-[ID]: [Requirement Category]
- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Response time targets (e.g., 95% of requests under 200ms)
  - Throughput requirements (e.g., 1000 concurrent users)
  - Resource utilization limits
- **Scalability Requirements**:
  - Expected growth patterns
  - Scaling triggers and mechanisms
  - Capacity planning considerations
- **Security Requirements**:
  - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
  - Data encryption standards (at rest and in transit)
  - Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Availability Requirements**:
  - Uptime SLA targets (e.g., 99.9% availability)
  - Disaster recovery requirements
  - Maintenance window specifications
```

### 3. Requirements Traceability Matrix
The RTM serves as the authoritative record of requirement origins, conflicts, resolutions, and implementation status, ensuring complete visibility into how project background information informs the specification package. Structure the matrix as:

#### Requirement Identification Section
```markdown
| Req ID | Requirement Title | Requirement Type | Priority | Status | Source Document | Source Location |
|--------|------------------|------------------|----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| BR-001 | [Business Requirement Title] | Business | High | Active | SOW v2.1 | Page 12, Section 3.2 |
| FR-001 | [Functional Requirement Title] | Functional | Medium | Active | BRD v1.2 | Page 8, Section 2.1 |
| NFR-001 | [Non-Functional Requirement Title] | Non-Functional | High | Active | Technical Assessment | Page 15, Performance Section |
```

#### Source Traceability Section
```markdown
| Req ID | Primary Source | Secondary Sources | Page/Section | Stakeholder | Date |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|------|
| BR-001 | SOW v2.1 | Meeting Notes 03/15, OQR | Page 12, Section 3.2 | John Smith (PM) | 2024-03-15 |
```

#### Conflict Documentation Section
```markdown
| Req ID | Conflict Description | Conflicting Sources | Conflict Location | Impact Level | Resolution Status | Resolution Details |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| FR-001 | Timeline discrepancy: SOW says 6 months, OQR says 4 months | SOW v2.1 vs OQR v1.3 | SOW Page 5, Section 1.3 vs OQR Page 3, Timeline Section | High | Resolved | Stakeholder meeting 03/20: Agreed on 5-month timeline |
```

#### Implementation Mapping Section
```markdown
| Req ID | User Story ID | Epic | Sprint | Implementation Status | Test Case ID | Acceptance Status |
|--------|---------------|------|--------|----------------------|--------------|------------------|
| FR-001 | US-001, US-002 | Epic-1 | Sprint 3 | In Progress | TC-001, TC-002 | Pending |
```
