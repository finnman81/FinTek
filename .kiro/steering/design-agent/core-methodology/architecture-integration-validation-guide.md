- **Requirements Coverage**: All functional and non-functional requirements have architectural solutions
- **Component Integration**: All component interfaces are properly defined and compatible
- **Service Limits**: AWS service limits are assessed with mitigation strategies
- **Technical Feasibility**: Technology choices and implementation complexity are validated
- **Documentation Completeness**: Architecture documentation meets quality standards
