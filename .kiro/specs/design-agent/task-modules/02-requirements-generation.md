# Stage 2: Requirements Generation

## Overview

**Objective**: Transform project documents into structured requirements packages
**Dependencies**: 
- Project analysis marked as complete in `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md`
- `core-methodology/requirements-generation-guide.md`
**Persona Focus**: Engineering Manager (EM) / Requirements Engineer

This stage focuses on systematic requirements analysis and generation, establishing the foundation for architecture design in Architecture Generation Stage . *Do Not* include architecture design in this stage.

## Task 2.1: Analyze Multi-Category Project Inputs

**Status**: Not Started
**Dependencies**: 
- Three-category input sources (project-context, technical-knowledge, organization-context)
- `core-methodology/input-assessment-analysis-guide.md`

**Description**: Conduct comprehensive three-category input assessment analysis following enhanced methodology to establish foundation for specification generation with clear context separation and requirements-focused processing

**Required Deliverable**: `generated/design/supplement-material/input-assessment-analysis.md` - Complete analysis document following standardized structure, placed in organized project folder structure

**File Structure Reference**: See main [tasks.md](../tasks.md) "File Structure & Storage Locations" section for complete storage location definitions.

**Methodology Reference**: Follow complete input assessment framework in `core-methodology/input-assessment-analysis-guide.md` including:
- Document inventory and cataloging framework (Primary/Secondary/Reference classification)
- **Legacy system context analysis** (existing architecture, technical debt, constraints)
- User context analysis methodology (personas, use cases, workflows)
- Information gap analysis framework (Critical/Important/Nice-to-Have categorization)
- Stakeholder requirements mapping methodology (analysis matrix, requirements categorization)
- Generation readiness assessment framework (scoring criteria, decision matrix)

### Key Activities

#### Three-Category Requirements Input Processing

**Category 1: Project Context Processing (`project-doc/project-context/`)**
- **Load Project-Specific Materials**: Analyze business requirements, user stories, and project documentation
- **Extract Core Requirements**: Identify functional requirements, business objectives, and user needs
- **Document Project Constraints**: Capture project-specific technical preferences and limitations
- **Generate Primary Requirements**: Create requirements that define "what we're building"

**Category 2: Technical Knowledge Processing (`project-doc/technical-knowledge/`)**
- **Load External Reference Materials**: Analyze API documentation, integration specifications, and external system references
- **Extract Integration Requirements**: Identify service limits, authentication patterns, and data formats WITHOUT treating as build targets
- **Document Compatibility Constraints**: Capture external system limitations that influence architecture
- **Generate Integration Specifications**: Create requirements that define "what we're integrating with"

**Category 3: Organization Context Processing (`project-doc/organization-context/`)**
- **Load Organizational Policies**: Analyze company standards, naming conventions, and compliance requirements
- **Extract Policy Constraints**: Identify mandatory tagging strategies, security policies, and budget limits
- **Document Compliance Requirements**: Capture organizational standards that must be applied consistently
- **Generate Organizational Constraints**: Create requirements that define "how we must build"

#### Context Separation and Classification
- **Maintain Category Boundaries**: Ensure clear separation between the three input categories throughout analysis
- **Apply Classification Framework**: Use enhanced document classification framework with category-specific processing
- **Prevent Misinterpretation**: Ensure external references are not treated as project build targets
- **Document Category Sources**: Maintain traceability linking analysis to specific input categories

#### Multi-Category Readiness Assessment
- **Category-Specific Gap Analysis**: Identify missing information within each of three input categories
- **Cross-Category Validation**: Ensure consistency and resolve conflicts between categories
- **Enhanced Stakeholder Mapping**: Map stakeholder requirements to appropriate input categories
- **Multi-Category Readiness Assessment**: Assess generation readiness across all three input categories using clear messaging format:

```
[Category Name]: Generation readiness assessment ([Score]/100)
  └─ [Content status and available capabilities]
```

**Assessment Messaging Examples:**
- Empty folders: "No input materials provided, but [available capabilities/fallbacks]"
- Populated folders: "[Content description] with [quality assessment]"
- Mixed scenarios: "[Available content] but missing [specific gaps]"

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Enhanced Methodology Compliance**: Analysis follows complete framework in `core-methodology/input-assessment-analysis-guide.md` with three-category processing
- **Category-Specific Analysis**: Separate analysis sections for project-context, technical-knowledge, and organization-context

- **Complete Document Structure**: `input-assessment-analysis.md` follows enhanced template structure with category-specific sections
- **Comprehensive Requirements Analysis**: All framework sections completed for each requirements input category
- **Category-Specific Traceability**: Requirements and analysis traceable to specific input categories and source documents
- **Quality Standards**: Analysis meets completeness, accuracy, and actionability criteria across the three requirements categories
