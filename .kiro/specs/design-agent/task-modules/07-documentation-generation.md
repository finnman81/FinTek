# Documentation Generation

## Overview

This module generates prescriptive guidance documentation, executive summaries, and comprehensive risk analysis to support implementation and stakeholder communication. It creates comprehensive MCP guidance, executive summaries, and project risk assessments that provide clear direction for development teams and key stakeholders.

**Concise Output Guidelines**: 
- **README.md**: Keep navigation structure but use 2-5 sentences per section, avoid lengthy explanations
- **Executive Summary**: Keep business sections but use bullet points and direct statements instead of paragraphs
- **Supplement Material**: Keep all sections but limit to 2-5 key points per section, focus on actionable information

## Task 7.1: Tools Prescriptive Guidance Generation

### Purpose
Generate comprehensive guidance on available development tools (MCP servers and Skills) and their recommended usage patterns to support development teams in selecting and implementing the right tools for their project needs.

### Reference Documentation
**CRITICAL**: Before executing this task, review the comprehensive tools recommendation framework:
- **Tools Recommendation Guidance**: #[[file:../../steering/design-agent/tools-recommendation-guidance.md]]

This steering document provides:
- Complete MCP server categorization (Essential, High-Value, Conditional)
- ProServe Skills framework overview
- Project analysis criteria for tool selection
- Workflow integration patterns for each design stage
- Configuration templates and quality standards
- Professional recommendation frameworks

### Tools Recommendation Process

**Step 1: Project Analysis for Tools Selection**
1. **Load Tools Recommendation Framework**
   - Read `tools-recommendation-guidance.md` completely to understand the comprehensive framework
   - Review MCP server categories (Essential, High-Value, Conditional)
   - Review ProServe Skills framework
   - Study project analysis criteria and recommendation patterns
   - Understand configuration templates and quality standards

2. **Apply Project Characteristics Assessment**
   - **Project Type Analysis**: Determine if greenfield vs. existing system, web application, AI/ML components, agent-based solution, data-intensive, budget-constrained
   - **Architecture Complexity Assessment**: Classify as simple, moderate, or complex based on project requirements
   - **Team Experience Evaluation**: Assess team AWS familiarity and tool preference (efficiency vs. learning-oriented)
   - **Timeline and Resource Constraints**: Consider project timeline and resource availability

3. **MCP Server Categorization Using Framework**
   - **Essential MCPs**: Apply framework criteria to identify always-required servers (typically AWS Knowledge, AWS Diagram)
   - **High-Value MCPs**: Identify servers recommended for most projects (Git Repo Research, AWS Documentation)
   - **Conditional MCPs**: Select project-specific servers based on analysis (Code Documentation, Synthetic Data, AWS Pricing, Bedrock AgentCore, Frontend, AWS API)

4. **ProServe Skills Framework Evaluation**
   - **ProServe Skills**: Evaluate fit for agent-based multi-component architectures
   - **Customization Approach**: Determine if ProServe Skills should be used as foundation, extended/adapted, or reference only

**Step 2: Project-Specific Tools Recommendations**
1. **Apply Recommendation Framework Decision Tree**
   - Use project analysis results to navigate tools selection decision tree
   - Match project characteristics to MCP server capabilities and skills patterns
   - Apply business justification criteria for each recommendation
   - Follow framework patterns and avoid documented anti-patterns

2. **Generate Configuration Strategy**
   - Create minimal, focused toolset to avoid complexity overhead
   - Prioritize efficiency over comprehensiveness based on project constraints
   - Include complete configuration examples for MCPs following framework templates
   - Include repository URLs and integration guidance for skills
   - Document usage patterns for each recommended tool in project context

3. **Validate Recommendations Against Framework**
   - Ensure recommendations follow framework patterns (Essential MCPs → High-Value MCPs → Conditional MCPs → Skills)
   - Verify business justification for each selected MCP server and skill
   - Confirm configuration examples are complete and actionable
   - Confirm skills integration guidance is clear and specific
   - Check that anti-patterns are avoided (e.g., recommending all tools without justification)

3. **Resource Assessment**: Evaluate team capabilities and resource constraints
4. **External Dependencies**: Identify third-party services and integration risks
5. **Timeline Analysis**: Assess schedule constraints and critical path risks
6. **Cost Modeling**: Analyze cost projections and budget constraints

**Step 3: Risk Prioritization Matrix**
Classify each risk using impact and probability assessment:

| Impact Level | Probability | Risk Level | Response Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **High** | High | **Critical** | Immediate mitigation required |
| **High** | Medium | **High** | Active monitoring and mitigation planning |
| **High** | Low | **Medium** | Contingency planning |
| **Medium** | High | **Medium** | Active monitoring |
| **Medium** | Medium | **Low** | Periodic review |
| **Low** | Any | **Low** | Accept and monitor |

### Common Risk Categories by Project Type

**Risk Relevance**: Only flag risks that threaten the project's stated goals. A POC validating a concept has different success criteria than a production system. Reference the project mode and requirements to determine which risks apply.

**Serverless/Cloud-Native Projects**:
- **Time**: Cold start optimization, service integration complexity
- **Budget**: Unexpected usage spikes, service cost escalation
- **Quality**: Observability gaps, security misconfiguration, error handling coverage
- **Scope**: Service limitations, compliance requirements

**Enterprise Applications**:
- **Time**: Legacy system integration, stakeholder alignment
- **Budget**: License costs, infrastructure requirements
- **Quality**: Scalability bottlenecks, security control gaps, operational complexity
- **Scope**: Regulatory requirements, organizational change management

**AI/ML Projects**:
- **Time**: Model training time, data preparation complexity
- **Budget**: Compute costs, data storage and processing
- **Quality**: Model accuracy validation, bias detection, inference latency
- **Scope**: Data availability, regulatory AI requirements

**Web Applications**:
- **Time**: Cross-browser compatibility, responsive design
- **Budget**: CDN costs, third-party service integration
- **Quality**: Performance budgets, accessibility compliance, error boundary coverage
- **Scope**: User experience requirements, mobile compatibility

### Risk Analysis Integration

**Executive Summary Integration**:
Include risk summary in executive summary under "Risk Management" section with:
- Top 3-5 critical risks with mitigation strategies
- Overall risk posture assessment (Low/Medium/High)
- Key success factors and monitoring approach

**Architecture Decision Integration**:
Reference risk analysis in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to show how architectural choices address identified risks.

**Implementation Planning Integration**:
Use risk analysis to inform implementation sequencing, with high-risk areas addressed early in development cycle.

### Quality Criteria
- **Comprehensiveness**: All major risk categories covered with specific risks identified
- **Actionability**: Each risk includes specific, implementable mitigation strategies
- **Traceability**: Risks linked to specific project components, requirements, or decisions
