# Task 9+: Incorporate Feedback (Iteration N)

Generate dynamic improvement tasks based on stakeholder feedback documents.

## Before Starting

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: This task creates NEW PROJECT FOLDERS only for stakeholder feedback iterations, NOT quality improvement iterations.

**Quality Iterations** (within same project):
- specification-package-iteration-1, specification-package-iteration-2, etc., with final as specification-package-iteration-final
- Handled by Task 4 (Holistic Quality Assessment)
- Stay within generated/design/ folder directly

**Feedback Iterations** (new project folders):
- Only when stakeholder provides feedback documents in `project-doc/feedback/iteration-N/`
- Creates new project folders: `[project-name]-feedback-iteration-1/`, `[project-name]-feedback-iteration-2/`, etc.
- Complete project regeneration based on feedback collected from the feedback folder

The feedback iteration number is **computed by counting existing feedback folders** in `project-doc/feedback/`. Count existing `iteration-*` folders and add 1 for the next iteration.

## Step 1: Change Detection and Analysis

**Step 1.1: Load Processing History**
```bash
# Load previous processing history if exists
if [ -f ".workflow-state/processing-history.md" ]; then
    echo "Loading previous processing history..."
    # Extract previous file fingerprints and processing metadata
else
    echo "No processing history found - treating as initial feedback iteration"
fi
```

**Processing History File Format** (`.workflow-state/processing-history.md`):
```markdown
# Processing History

## Iteration 1 - 2025-01-15 14:30:00
**Type:** Initial Generation
**Files Processed:** 12
**Total Fingerprints:** 12

### File Fingerprints

### File Fingerprints (Current)
[Complete list of all current file fingerprints...]
```

**Step 1.2: Scan Current Inputs and Generate Fingerprints**
```bash
# Count existing feedback folders to determine current iteration
ITERATION=$(find project-doc/feedback/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "iteration-*" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
ITERATION=$((ITERATION + 1))
FEEDBACK_DIR="project-doc/feedback/iteration-${ITERATION}"

# Alternative method: Count existing feedback tasks in design-handoff.md
# ITERATION=$(grep -o '"taskName": "Feedback Iteration [0-9]*"' .workflow-state/design-handoff.md | wc -l)
# ITERATION=$((ITERATION + 1))

# Generate SHA-256 fingerprints for all input files
find project-doc/ -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > .workflow-state/current-fingerprints.tmp

# List all feedback files
find "$FEEDBACK_DIR" -type f
```

**Step 1.3: Categorize Changes**
```bash
# Compare current fingerprints against processing history
# Categorize as: NEW, MODIFIED, REMOVED, UNCHANGED
```

**Current Fingerprints File Format** (`.workflow-state/current-fingerprints.tmp`):
```
abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234  project-doc/project-context/requirements.md

```
**Note:** This is a temporary file generated during processing and cleaned up after change categorization is complete.

**Step 1.4: Generate Change Summary**
Create `.workflow-state/change-summary-iteration-${ITERATION}.md` documenting:
- New files discovered
- Modified files with fingerprint changes
- Removed files no longer present
- Processing strategy (incremental vs full)
- Estimated time savings

**Change Summary File Format** (`.workflow-state/change-summary-iteration-N.md`):
```markdown
# Change Summary - Iteration N

## Processing Strategy
**Mode:** Incremental Processing
**Previous Iteration:** Iteration N-1 (2025-01-15 14:30:00)
**Current Iteration:** Iteration N (2025-01-20 16:45:00)

## Change Detection Results

### New Files (3)
- `project-doc/feedback/iteration-N/stakeholder-review.md`
  - **Size:** 2.4 KB

- **Cache Hit Rate:** 75%
```

**Expected feedback types:**
- Stakeholder review comments
- Technical review feedback
- Security assessment findings
- Business requirement clarifications
- Architecture improvement suggestions
- User story refinements

## Step 2: Conflict Detection and Analysis

**Step 2.1: Load Previous Specifications**
```bash
# Identify most recent project iteration folder
LATEST_ITERATION=$(ls -1 generated/design/ | grep "project-name-iteration-" | sort -V | tail -1)
echo "Loading specifications from: $LATEST_ITERATION"

# Load all specification documents:
# - Requirements documents
# - Architecture specifications  
# - ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
# - Quality assessment results
# - Security threat model
```

**Step 2.2: Incremental Feedback Processing**
For each feedback document, perform incremental analysis:
- **New Files**: Full analysis and integration with existing analysis
- **Modified Files**: Differential analysis to extract only new/changed information
- **Unchanged Files**: Reuse cached analysis from previous iteration

**Step 2.3: Semantic Conflict Detection**
Compare new feedback against existing requirements and decisions:

### Conflict Types to Detect:
- **Direct Contradiction**: New feedback explicitly contradicts previous requirement
- **Implicit Conflict**: New feedback implies different approach than existing architecture  
- **Scope Conflict**: New feedback changes project boundaries
- **Technical Conflict**: New feedback requires incompatible technology choices

### Conflict Analysis Process:
1. Extract requirements and constraints from new feedback
2. Compare against existing requirements using semantic analysis
3. Identify contradictions using pattern matching
4. Classify conflict severity: CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR

**Step 2.4: Generate Conflict Report**
Create `.workflow-state/conflicts-iteration-${ITERATION}.md` with:
- Detailed conflict descriptions
- Original vs new requirements
- Resolution options with pros/cons
- Recommended resolution with rationale
- Impact analysis for each conflict

**Conflict Report File Format** (`.workflow-state/conflicts-iteration-N.md`):
```markdown
# Conflicts Report - Iteration N

## Executive Summary
- **Total Conflicts:** 2
- **Critical:** 1, **Major:** 1, **Minor:** 0
- **Estimated Resolution Time:** 2 hours
- **Architecture Impact:** Yes

- Reliability improvements
- Cost optimization suggestions

## Step 4: Conflict Resolution (User Interaction)

**CRITICAL**: If conflicts were detected in Step 2.4, the workflow MUST pause here for user resolution.

**MANDATORY PAUSE**: This step requires explicit user interaction. The agent MUST NOT proceed to Step 5 until the user has reviewed and approved all conflict resolutions.

**Step 4.1: Present Conflicts to User**
**REQUIRED FORMAT**: Present each conflict with this exact structure:
1. **Conflict Title and Severity** (e.g., "Authentication Method [CRITICAL]")
2. **Current Design**: What the existing specification says
3. **Customer Feedback**: What the new feedback requests
4. **Resolution Options**: List all options with pros/cons
5. **Recommended Option**: Clearly marked with rationale
6. **Impact Summary**: Timeline, effort, and risk implications

**Step 4.2: Wait for User Decisions**
**MANDATORY PAUSE**: The agent MUST stop processing and wait for explicit user input on each conflict:
- Present all conflicts in a clear, structured format
- Ask user to confirm their resolution choice for each conflict
- Do NOT assume or proceed without explicit user confirmation
- User must respond with: "Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", or "Custom"

**Step 4.3: Document Resolution Decisions**
Only after receiving user decisions, record them in the conflict resolution log.

**Conflict Resolution Log File Format** (`.workflow-state/conflict-resolution-log-iteration-N.md`):
```markdown
# Conflict Resolution Log - Iteration N

## Resolution Session
**Date:** 2025-01-20 16:45:00
**Decision Maker:** [Name/Role]
**Total Conflicts:** 2
**Resolution Time:** 45 minutes

**Decision Maker:** Technical Lead (Alice Johnson)
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-20 16:30:00
**Rationale:** "Compliance requirements are non-negotiable for enterprise deployment. The 2-week delay is acceptable given the business impact of compliance failure."
**Implementation Notes:** 
- Schedule SAML IdP integration planning session
- Update authentication component design
- Revise security threat model
- Plan comprehensive testing approach

### Conflict 2: Scalability Requirements
**Decision:** Option 1 - Accept New (10,000 concurrent users)
**Decision Maker:** Product Manager (Bob Smith)
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-20 16:40:00
**Rationale:** "Market research shows we need this capacity for enterprise customers. The architecture investment is justified."
**Implementation Notes:**
- Add auto-scaling components to architecture
- Implement caching layer
- Update performance testing requirements

## Impact Summary
**Total Conflicts Resolved:** 2
**Critical Decisions:** 1
**Architecture Changes Required:** Yes
**Estimated Additional Effort:** 3 weeks
**Quality Score Impact:** Minimal (expected 91/100)
**Next Steps:** Proceed with specification updates based on resolutions
```

**Step 4.4: Apply Conflict Resolutions**
Update requirements and specifications based on user decisions before proceeding.

**WORKFLOW CHECKPOINT**: Only proceed to Step 5 after:
1. All conflicts have been presented to the user
2. User has provided explicit decisions for each conflict
3. Conflict resolution decisions have been documented
4. User has confirmed they want to proceed with implementation

**If no conflicts detected**: Document "No conflicts found" and proceed directly to Step 5.

## Step 5: Change Impact Analysis

**Step 5.1: Analyze Requirements Impact**
Identify affected requirements:
- New requirements to be added
- Modified requirements with changes
- Removed requirements (out of scope)
- Dependent requirements affected by changes

**Step 5.2: Analyze Architecture Impact**
Identify affected architecture components:
- Components requiring redesign
- Components requiring updates
- Components no longer needed
- New components required

**Step 5.3: Analyze Security Impact**
Identify affected security elements:
- Threats requiring updates
- Security controls requiring changes
- New threats introduced
- Mitigations no longer applicable

**Step 5.4: Classify Severity and Estimate Effort**
For each impacted component:
- **Severity**: Critical/Major/Minor/Informational
- **Effort**: Low/Medium/High
- **Risk**: Low/Medium/High

**Step 5.5: Generate Impact Report**
Create `.workflow-state/change-impact-iteration-${ITERATION}.md` with:
- Executive summary of changes
- Detailed impact analysis per component
- Cumulative impact assessment
- Effort estimates and timeline impact
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**Change Impact Report File Format** (`.workflow-state/change-impact-iteration-N.md`):

```

## Step 6: Generate Improvement Tasks

**CRITICAL**: All improvement tasks must follow the **copy-then-update pattern** for complete project regeneration.

### **Task Generation Requirements**

1. **First Task: Complete Project Copy**
   - **Task Name**: "Create new complete project iteration folder"
   - **Purpose**: Copy entire existing project to new feedback iteration folder
   - **Process**: 
     - **Identify source project folder**: Look for the project-specific folder in `generated/design/` (direct structure)
     - **Copy to new feedback iteration folder**: `generated/design/[project-name]-feedback-iteration-N/` (e.g., `generated/design/knowledge-base-assistant-feedback-iteration-1/`)
     - **Copy latest specification package only**: Find highest numbered `specification-package-iteration-X/` (or `specification-package-iteration-final/`) and copy as `specification-package/`
     - **Copy all other files**: README.md, executive-summary.md, score-sheet-iteration-X.md (latest only), threat-model/, supplement-material/

2. **Latest Specification Package Selection**
   - **Find highest numbered**: `specification-package-iteration-1/`, `specification-package-iteration-2/`, etc., or `specification-package-iteration-final/`
   - **Copy only the latest**: If iteration-final exists, copy that one; otherwise copy highest numbered iteration
   - **Rename to specification-package**: In feedback folder, use simple naming without iteration numbers
   - **Skip older iterations**: Don't copy iteration-1, iteration-2 if iteration-final or higher iteration exists

3. **Subsequent Tasks: Selective Updates**
   - **Update Pattern**: Only modify files affected by feedback
   - **Naming Convention**: Updated files get "-updated" suffix
   - **Preserve Originals**: Keep original files alongside updated versions
   - **Examples**:
     - `architecture/system-architecture-updated.md`
     - `requirements/functional-requirements-updated.md`

### **Task Breakdown Guidelines**

1. **Improvement Areas**: What aspects of the design need updates?
   - Requirements, Architecture, Security, Documentation, etc.
   - Prioritize by impact and dependencies

2. **Task Organization**: How should improvements be structured?
   - **Task 1**: Always "Create new complete project iteration folder"
   - **Task 2+**: Specific updates with "-updated" file naming
   - Group related changes together
   - Ensure each task has clear scope

3. **Reference Mapping**: Link tasks to feedback sources
   - Trace back to specific feedback documents
   - Reference original specification sections being updated
   - Maintain audit trail

4. **Implementation Notes**: Capture key guidance
   - Rationale for changes
   - Impact on existing specifications
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - File naming conventions ("-updated" suffix)

## Step 7: Populate design-handoff.md

Update `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md` by **adding your generated improvement tasks as subtasks** to the current Feedback Iteration task.

**IMPORTANT**: The first subtask should always be "Create new complete project iteration folder" which will:
1. **Copy from source project**: `generated/design/[project-name]/` 
2. **To new feedback iteration folder**: `generated/design/[project-name]-feedback-iteration-N/`
3. **Copy latest specification package only**: Find highest numbered `specification-package-iteration-X/` and copy as `specification-package/`
4. **Copy all other files**: README.md, executive-summary.md, latest score-sheet-iteration-X.md, threat-model/, supplement-material/
5. **Then subsequent tasks update only changed files** with "-updated" suffix

### IMPORTANT: Add as Subtasks, Not Top-Level Tasks

Find the current "Feedback Iteration N" task in the taskDetails array and **append your generated tasks to its subtasks array**. Do NOT create new top-level tasks.

### Task Structure Example

If the current task is "Task 9: Feedback Iteration 1" with subtasks 9.1-9.4, you should add your generated tasks as 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, etc.:

```json
{
  "taskDetails": [
    {
      "taskNumber": "9",
      "taskName": "Feedback Iteration 1",
      "status": "current",
      "referenceDocuments": ["project-doc/feedback/iteration-1/"],
      "implementationNotes": "Review feedback and generate improvement tasks, then create new complete project iteration folder",
      "subtasks": [
        {
          "taskNumber": "9.1",
          "taskName": "Change detection and conflict analysis",
          "status": "complete"
        },
        {
          "taskNumber": "9.2",
          "taskName": "Conflict resolution and impact analysis",
          "status": "current"
        },

          "taskName": "Generate feedback implementation tasks",
          "status": "not_started"
        },
        {
          "taskNumber": "9.4",
          "taskName": "Populate design-handoff.md with generated feedback tasks",
          "status": "not_started"
        },
        {
          "taskNumber": "9.5",
          "taskName": "Create new complete project iteration folder",
          "status": "not_started",
          "referenceDocuments": [
            "generated/design/[project-name]"
          ],
          "implementationNotes": "Copy complete folder structure from generated/design/ to generated/design/[project-name]-feedback-iteration-1/: latest specification-package-iteration-X/ (or iteration-final/) as specification-package/, README.md, executive-summary.md, latest score-sheet, threat-model/, supplement-material/"
        },
        {
          "taskNumber": "9.6",
          "taskName": "Update Requirements Based on Stakeholder Feedback",
          "status": "not_started",
          "referenceDocuments": [
            "project-doc/feedback/iteration-1/stakeholder-review.md",
            "generated/design/[project-name]-feedback-iteration-1/specification-package/requirements/"
          ],
          "implementationNotes": "Update authentication requirements with SAML 2.0, create functional-requirements-updated.md with MFA requirements per stakeholder feedback in generated/design/knowledge-base-assistant-feedback-iteration-1/"
        },
        {
          "taskNumber": "9.7",
          "taskName": "Revise Architecture for Scalability",
          "status": "not_started",
          "referenceDocuments": [
            "project-doc/feedback/iteration-1/technical-review.md",
            "generated/design/[project-name]-feedback-iteration-1/specification-package/architecture/"
          ],
          "implementationNotes": "Create system-architecture-updated.md with auto-scaling and caching layer to handle 10x traffic growth per technical review in generated/design/knowledge-base-assistant-feedback-iteration-1/"
        },
        {
          "taskNumber": "9.8",
          "taskName": "Enhance Security Controls",
          "status": "not_started",
          "referenceDocuments": [
            "project-doc/feedback/iteration-1/security-review.md",
            "generated/design/[project-name]-feedback-iteration-1/threat-model/"
          ],
          "implementationNotes": "Create threat-analysis-updated.md and security-controls-updated.md with encryption at rest per security review in generated/design/knowledge-base-assistant-feedback-iteration-1/"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Required Fields for Each Generated Subtask

- **taskNumber**: Use format `N.X` where N is the feedback task number and X is sequential (8.5, 8.6, 8.7, etc.)
- **taskName**: Clear, descriptive name indicating what will be updated
- **status**: Always "not_started" initially
- **referenceDocuments**: Array of feedback docs and specification sections being updated
- **implementationNotes**: Brief summary of changes and rationale

### Important: Task Numbering

If the current task is "Task 9: Feedback Iteration 1" with existing subtasks 9.1-9.4:
- **Task 9.1**: Review and analyze feedback (already exists)
- **Task 9.2**: Generate improvement tasks (already exists - this task)
- **Task 9.3**: Populate design-handoff.md (already exists)
- **Task 9.4**: Create new complete project iteration folder (already exists)
- **Task 9.5+**: Your generated improvement subtasks (add these)

### Guidelines for Task Generation

1. **Logical Grouping**: Group related improvements together (e.g., all requirements changes in one subtask)
2. **Clear Scope**: Each subtask should update specific specification sections
3. **Traceability**: Link back to feedback documents and original specs
4. **Completeness**: Ensure all feedback is addressed
5. **Dependencies**: Order subtasks by dependencies (requirements before architecture)
6. **Flat Structure**: Do NOT create nested subtasks - keep all generated tasks at the same level (9.5, 9.6, 9.7, etc.)

## Step 9: Validation & Completion

Before marking Task 9.2 complete:

1. **Verify Coverage**: Does your plan address all feedback?
2. **Check Dependencies**: Are subtasks ordered correctly?
3. **Validate References**: Do all referenced documents exist?
4. **Review Scope**: Is the plan appropriate for the feedback received?
5. **Confirm Structure**: Are all generated tasks added as subtasks (8.5+) to the Feedback Iteration task?

## After Completion

Update `.workflow-state/design-handoff.md`:
- Mark Task 9.2 as "complete"
- Update lastUpdated timestamp
- Add note summarizing your analysis:
  - Number of improvement subtasks generated
  - Key feedback themes identified
  - Specification areas being updated
  - Any concerns or clarifications needed

**Version History File Format** (`.workflow-state/version-history.md`):
```markdown
# Specification Version History

## Iteration 1 - 2025-01-15 14:30:00

## Troubleshooting

**If no feedback documents found:**
- Verify the iteration folder exists
- Check if user cancelled feedback process
- Confirm feedback documents are in correct location

**If feedback is unclear or contradictory:**
- Document ambiguities in implementationNotes
- Create tasks to clarify requirements with stakeholders
- Flag conflicting feedback for resolution

**If feedback requires major redesign:**
- Break down into manageable incremental changes
- Prioritize critical changes first
- Document scope of changes clearly
- Consider creating multiple complete project iteration folders
