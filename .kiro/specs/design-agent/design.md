# Design Agent Workflow - Design Document

## Architecture Overview

This workflow implements an orchestrated process with modular task architecture that transforms project documents into enterprise-grade specification packages through systematic progression across multiple stages.

Each stage has focused objectives and clear quality gates, progressing from initial session management through requirements generation, systematic architecture design with research-driven technology selection, holistic quality assessment, comprehensive security evaluation, and final output organization.

## Modular Task Architecture

The workflow is organized into focused, modular task files for better organization and clarity:

- **Stage 0: Session Management Module** - Execution modes, handoff protocols, and session recovery
- **Stage 1: Project Analysis Module** - Project complexity assessment and workflow recommendations  
- **Stage 2: Requirements Generation Module** - Input assessment and requirements package generation
- **Stage 3: Architecture Generation Module** - Systematic architecture design with research-driven technology selection
- **Stage 4: Holistic Quality Assessment Module** - Comprehensive quality evaluation and iterative improvement
- **Stage 5: Security Assessment Module** - Threat modeling and security controls integration
- **Stage 6: Property Identification Module** - Property identification for all functional requirements to enable property based testing
- **Stage 7: Documentation Generation Module** - MCP prescriptive guidance and executive summary generation
- **Stage 8: Output Organization Module** - Project folder structure and deliverable organization requirements
- **Stage 9+: Feedback Integration Module** - Stakeholder feedback analysis and iterative improvement task generation

## Enhanced Project Input System Architecture

### Input Category Framework

The input system processes project materials in two distinct phases to maintain proper separation between requirements and architecture concerns.

## Requirements Generation Phase (Stage 2)

Processes three categories of project materials to establish pure business-driven requirements:

#### Category 1: Project Context (`project-doc/project-context/`)
**Purpose**: Project-specific requirements, business context, and stakeholder needs
**Processing Logic**:
- Extract core business objectives and functional requirements
- Identify user personas, workflows, and success criteria
- Document project-specific constraints and technical preferences
- Generate primary functional and non-functional requirements
**Output**: Core project requirements that define "what we're building"

#### Category 2: Technical Knowledge (`project-doc/technical-knowledge/`)
**Purpose**: External reference materials and integration specifications
**Processing Logic**:
- Analyze external API documentation without treating as build targets
- Extract integration patterns, data formats, and authentication requirements
- Identify service limits, rate limits, and compatibility constraints
- Document how external systems influence architecture decisions
**Output**: Integration requirements that define "what we're integrating with"

#### Category 3: Organization Context (`project-doc/organization-context/`)
**Purpose**: Company policies, standards, and organizational constraints
**Processing Logic**:
- Extract naming conventions, tagging strategies, and resource patterns
- Apply security policies, compliance requirements, and budget constraints
- Enforce organizational standards across all architecture decisions
- Validate against company-specific requirements (MAP credits, cost allocation)
**Output**: Organizational constraints that define "how we must build"

## Architecture Generation Phase (Stage 3)

Incorporates reference system analysis to inform architecture decisions:

#### Project Code Analysis (from Stage 1 output)
**Purpose**: Existing codebases and reference system analysis
**Processing Logic**:
- Use comprehensive codebase analysis from Stage 1 (stored in `.workflow-state/reference-architectures/`)
- Identify reusable components and integration opportunities
- Document existing system dependencies and integration requirements
- Generate integration strategies and compatibility requirements
**Output**: Reference system considerations that inform "how we can leverage existing assets"

### Context Separation Engine

**Classification Logic**:
- Folder-based automatic categorization prevents content misinterpretation
- Clear boundaries between project scope and external dependencies
- Organizational constraints applied consistently across all decisions
- Reference system analysis separated from requirements generation

**Traceability Framework**:
- Requirements linked to specific input categories and source documents (project-context, technical-knowledge, organization-context only)
- Architecture decisions traced to requirements plus reference system analysis
- Compliance documentation showing organizational policy application
- Integration specifications clearly separated from build requirements

### Processing Workflow Integration

**Stage 0-1 Integration**: Input discovery, categorization, and project-code analysis during session management and project analysis
**Stage 2 Integration**: Three-category processing during requirements generation (project-context, technical-knowledge, organization-context)
**Stage 3 Integration**: Requirements-driven architecture generation informed by reference system analysis from Stage 1
**Stage 4-7 Integration**: Category-specific validation during quality assessment and final documentation
